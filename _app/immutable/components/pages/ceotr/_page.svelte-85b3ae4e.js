When the user hovers over the track,  the track will be highlighted and show summarized information. The table is sortable and shows detailed information. On the right side of the table, the eye button can control the show/hide for each track shown on the map, and the eye button on the table's header can simply show/hide all the tracks. The table is sorted by mission number by default, and the mission number is clickable. By clicking the mission number, the user will be directed to the individual mission page, which shows more detail. The filter bar can filter out the missions that the user wants.
