The player can purchase and gear up powerful items in the store. The coin can be dropped by the enemy. The stronger the enemy is, the more coin will be dropped.

As a portfolio, it records all my projects, which include my Co-op term projects, Game Jam projects, personal projects, etc. It is also a recap of the Svelte knowledge I learned during the Co-op term. The main component of this website is the project card. I modularized each project as a project card. Each project card has three parts: title, image viewer, and description. The modularization lets me post new projects quicker, and easy to maintain the website. In further development, I will try to add a bilingual function and be able to switch between English and Chinese."}}),{c(){e=d("div"),o=d("h1"),c=I("Personal Projects"),p=f(),u(r.$$.fragment),l=f(),u(s.$$.fragment)},l(t){e=g(t,"DIV",{});var a=w(e);o=g(a,"H1",{});var h=w(o);c=L(h,"Personal Projects"),h.forEach(m),p=b(a),y(r.$$.fragment,a),l=b(a),y(s.$$.fragment,a),a.forEach(m)},m(t,a){R(t,e,a),i(e,o),i(o,c),i(e,p),$(r,e,null),i(e,l),$(s,e,null),n=!0},p:S,i(t){n||(_(r.$$.fragment,t),_(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!0)},o(t){j(r.$$.fragment,t),j(s.$$.fragment,t),n=!1},d(t){t&&m(e),v(r),v(s)}}}class H extends U{constructor(e){super(),k(this,e,null,B,x,{})}}export{H as default};
